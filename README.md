Builds a website that prompts a visitor for input as the page loads. The user input is based off the following prompt and user story:

Prompt: "As you pick out your froyo flavor at your favorite local frozen yogurt shop, you overhear the management team discussing how they would like a way for customers to order online. You make small talk and offer your services to help them build a web app."

User Story: "A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website, to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type 'vanilla, vanilla, vanilla, strawberry, coffee, coffee'. When they view the browser console, they observe a table that lists how many of each flavor have been ordered. In this case, they will be able to observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee and one strawberry froyo."
